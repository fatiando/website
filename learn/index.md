# Learn how to use our software

<p class="lead">
Learning how to use Python libraries can be challenging, particularly if you're
new to Python.
Don't worry!
Here are some resources to help you get started.

## Tutorials

Our [YouTube channel][youtube]
has video tutorials, demonstrations, and talks about several of the tools
that we develop.

```{note}
Videos will usually include links to all source code and instructions in
the description.
```

## Documentation

The best place to learn more about each particular tool is their
**documentation pages** (AKA the *docs*):

* [Pooch](https://www.fatiando.org/pooch)
* [Verde](https://www.fatiando.org/verde)
* [Harmonica](https://www.fatiando.org/harmonica)
* [Boule](https://www.fatiando.org/boule)

The docs contain full descriptions of every function and class in each package,
examples of their usage, and explanations of the theory behind certain methods.

```{tip}
Need documentation for a **specific version** of a package? There are links in
each documentation page to all previous versions and as well as the latest
release.
```

```{admonition} Looking for the Python 2.7 <code>fatiando</code> library?
**It still exists!**
While development of the `fatiando` library has stopped in favour of our new
tools, you can still install it and view the documentation for version 0.5 at
[legacy.fatiando.org](https://legacy.fatiando.org)
```

## New to Python?

If you don't have much experience with Python, **don't worry!**
A great place to start learning Python for scientific computation and much more
is [Software Carpentry][swc].
We recommend starting with these two lessons (also available in Spanish):

<ul class="fa-ul icon-list-small">
  <li>
     <i class="fa-li fa fa-book fa-fw"></i>
     <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/">Programming with Python</a>
  </li>
  <li>
     <i class="fa-li fa fa-book fa-fw"></i>
     <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/">Plotting and Programming in Python</a>
  </li>
</ul>
