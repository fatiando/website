# Learn how to use our software

<p class="lead">
Learning how to use Python libraries can be challenging, particularly if you're
new to Python.
Don't worry!
Here are some resources to help you get started.

## Tutorials

Our [YouTube channel][youtube]
has video tutorials, demonstrations, and talks about several of the tools
that we develop.

Videos will usually include links to the tutorial source code and instructions
in the description.
Tutorials are organized in a [playlist][yt-tutorials] for easier access.

## Documentation

The best place to learn more about each particular tool is their
**documentation pages** (AKA the *docs*):

* [Pooch](https://www.fatiando.org/pooch)
* [Verde](https://www.fatiando.org/verde)
* [Harmonica](https://www.fatiando.org/harmonica)
* [Boule](https://www.fatiando.org/boule)

The docs contain full descriptions of every function and class in each package,
examples of their usage, and explanations of the theory behind certain methods.

```{tip}
Need documentation for a **specific version** of a package? There are links in
each documentation page to all previous versions and as well as the latest
release.
```

```{admonition} Looking for the Python 2.7 <code>fatiando</code> library?
**It still exists!**
While development of the `fatiando` library has stopped in favour of our new
tools, you can still install it and view the documentation for version 0.5 at
[legacy.fatiando.org](https://legacy.fatiando.org)
```

## New to Python?

If you don't have much experience with Python, **don't worry!**
A great place to start learning Python for scientific computation and much more
is [Software Carpentry][swc].
We recommend starting with these two lessons (also available in Spanish):

<ul class="fa-ul icon-list-small">
  <li>
     <i class="fa-li fa fa-book fa-fw"></i>
     <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/">Programming with Python</a>
  </li>
  <li>
     <i class="fa-li fa fa-book fa-fw"></i>
     <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/">Plotting and Programming in Python</a>
  </li>
</ul>

The [Software Underground][swung] community has also produced
[introduction to Python tutorials][swung-python-playlist] as part of the *Transform*
events.
The best part is that they are all focused on Geoscience applications.
