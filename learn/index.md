# Learn how to use our software

<p class="lead">
Learning how to use Python libraries can be challenging, particularly if you're
new to Python.
Don't worry!
Here are some resources to help you get started.
</p>

## Tutorials

Our [YouTube channel][youtube]
has video tutorials, demonstrations, and talks about several of the tools
that we develop.

Videos will usually include links to the tutorial source code and instructions
in the description.
Tutorials are organized in a [playlist][yt-tutorials] for easier access.

## Documentation

The best place to learn more about each particular tool is their
**documentation pages** (AKA the *docs*):

<div class="mt-2">

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.fatiando.org/pooch">
<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary mb-3 me-3">
<i class="fa fa-book"></i>
Pooch
</button></a>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.fatiando.org/verde">
<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary mb-3 me-3">
<i class="fa fa-book"></i>
Verde
</button></a>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.fatiando.org/harmonica">
<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary mb-3 me-3">
<i class="fa fa-book"></i>
Harmonica
</button></a>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.fatiando.org/boule">
<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary mb-3">
<i class="fa fa-book"></i>
Boule
</button></a>

</div>

The docs contain full descriptions of every function and class in each package,
examples of their usage, and explanations of the theory behind certain methods.

```{tip}
Need documentation for a **specific version** of a package? There are links in
each documentation page to all previous versions and as well as the latest
release.
```

```{admonition} Looking for the Python 2.7 <code>fatiando</code> library?
**It still exists!**
While development of the `fatiando` library has stopped in favour of our new
tools, you can still install it and view the documentation for version 0.5 at
[legacy.fatiando.org](https://legacy.fatiando.org)
```

## New to Python?

If you don't have much experience with Python, **don't worry!**

[Software Carpentry][swc] provides open-source lessons (also available in
Spanish) about Python for scientific computing and much more.
This is a great resource and all they teach is worth learning.
We recommend starting with these two:
["Programming with Python"][swc-python]
and
["Plotting and Programming in Python"][swc-python2].

</div>

</div>
<div class="col-md-3">

The [Software Sustainability Institute][ssi] has a recording of the
"Programming with Python" lesson freely [available on YouTube][yt-swc].

</div>


The [Software Underground][swung] community has also produced
[introduction to Python tutorials][swung-python-playlist] as part of the *Transform*
events.
The best part is that they are all focused on Geoscience applications.

We recommend the ["Getting started with Python"][swung-intro-python] tutorial
by [Robert Leckenby](https://github.com/Zabamund).
