# Community

<p class="lead">
Fatiando is a <strong>community-developed</strong> project. It's people
like you who make it useful and successful!
Our tools are developed by <strong>working geoscientists and community
volunteers</strong> from across the globe.
</p>

## <i class="fa fa-comments"></i> Participate

Open-source is more than just code, **it's about the people** involved.
The most important thing you can do for any project is **participate in the
community**: ask and answer questions, share your experience, help guide the
development, and make friends along the way.

The Fatiando community gathers in a few different places online, all of which
are **open to everyone**.
So come along and join the conversation!
See {ref}`contact` to find out where we gather.

## <i class="fa fa-users"></i> Who we are

The organization structure of Fatiando is outlined in our [Governance
document][governance]. It specifies the existing roles within our community,
what are the responsibilities assigned to each one, and how to gain
responsibilities within our organization.
Below is a list of the people currently occupying each role.

### Steering Council

The overall role of the Steering Council is to ensure the long-term well-being of the
project. It is composed
of community members who have distinguished themselves by making substantial
contributions to the project over time.

```{fatiando-governance} community/steering-council.json
```

```{admonition} Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL)
The BDFL is chair of the Steering Council and has the same responsibilities of
other Council members.
As *Dictator*, they also have the authority to make all final decisions for the
project.
As *Benevolent*, they, in practice, chooses to defer that authority to the
consensus of the Community and Steering Council.
```
