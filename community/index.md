# Community

<p class="lead">
Fatiando is a <strong>community-developed</strong> project. It's people
like you who make it useful and successful!
</p>

```{important}
Everyone is required to abide by our [Code of Conduct][coc] when participating
in the Fatiando community. Please review it carefully.
```

## <i class="fa fa-comments"></i> Participate

Open-source is more than just code, **it's about the people** involved.
The most important thing you can do for any project is **participate in the
community**: ask and answer questions, share your experience, help guide the
development, and make friends along the way.

The Fatiando community gathers in a few different places, **all of which are
completely open to everyone**.
So come along and join the conversation!

### Text-based

Asynchronous communication for anything from technical discussions to random
chat:

<ul class="fa-ul">
<li>

<i class="fa-li fab fa-slack fa-fw"></i>
[Slack][slack]: where most conversation happens about meetings, events,
questions, etc.

</li>
<li>

<i class="fa-li fab fa-github fa-fw"></i>
[GitHub][gh]:
where we discuss development details, review code, etc.

</li>
</ul>

### Video calls

Synchronous online calls to tackle topics when text-based discussion becomes
inefficient and mostly get to know each other better:

<ul class="fa-ul">
<li>

<i class="fa-li fa fa-microphone-alt fa-fw"></i>
[Community Calls][notes]:
Regular calls to socialize and discuss project directions (not technical
details).

</li>
<li>

<i class="fa-li fa fa-code fa-fw"></i>
[Development Calls][notes]:
Weekly calls more focused on development discussion (implementation details,
road maps, issues, etc.). Everyone is welcome to join, regardless of skill
level!

</li>
</ul>

```{note}
Dates, connection details, agendas, and past notes from meetings are available
at <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [`fatiando/meeting-notes`][notes].
```

## <i class="fa fa-cog"></i> Join the development

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're
not ready; that your skills aren't nearly good
enough to contribute.
What could you possibly offer?
We assure you that the little voice in your head is wrong.

**Being a contributor doesn't just mean writing code**.
There are many ways to contribute:

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-bug fa-fw"></i> Submitting bug reports and feature requests</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-book fa-fw"></i> Writing tutorials or examples</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-hammer fa-fw"></i> Fixing typos and improving to the documentation</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-terminal fa-fw"></i> Writing code for everyone to use</li>
</ul>

Have a look at our [Contributing Guide][contrib] to see how you can get
involved.
This and other guides (for project maintenance, etc.) can be found in the
[<i class="fab fa-github"></i> `fatiando/contributing`][contrib-repo]
repository.
