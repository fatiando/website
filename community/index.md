<p class="lead">
Fatiando is a <strong>community-developed</strong> project, so it's people
like you who make it useful and successful!
</p>

## <i class="fa fa-comments"></i> Participate

Open-source is more than just code, **it's about the people involved**.
The most important thing you can do for any project is participate in the
community: ask and answer questions, share your experience, help guide the
development, and make friends along the way.

```{important}
Everyone is expected to abide by our [Code of Conduct][coc] when participating
in the Fatiando community. Please review it carefully.
```

The Fatiando community gathers in a few different places, **all of which are
completely open to everyone**. So come along and join the conversation:

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li>
  <i class="fa-li fab fa-slack fa-fw"></i> <a href="http://contact.fatiando.org/">Slack</a>:
  where most conversation happens about meetings, events, questions, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i class="fa-li fab fa-github fa-fw"></i> <a href="https://github.com/fatiando/">GitHub</a>:
  where we discuss development details, review code, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
  <i class="fa-li fa fa-microphone-alt fa-fw"></i> <a href="https://github.com/fatiando/meeting-notes">Community Calls</a>:
  regular video calls to discuss the latest developments, project
  directions, and have a little social interaction. <strong>We welcome everyone
  interested in Fatiando to take part!</strong> Calls happen once a month (check
  <a href="http://calendar.fatiando.org">our calendar</a> for the next one)
  and are live-streamed to
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/FatiandoOrg">our YouTube channel</a>.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're
not ready; that your skills aren't nearly good
enough to contribute.
What could you possibly offer?
We assure you that the little voice in your head is wrong.

**Being a contributor doesn't just mean writing code**.
There are many ways to contribute:

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-bug fa-fw"></i> Submitting bug reports and feature requests</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-book fa-fw"></i> Writing tutorials or examples</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-hammer fa-fw"></i> Fixing typos and improving to the documentation</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-terminal fa-fw"></i> Writing code for everyone to use</li>
</ul>

Have a look at our [Contributing Guide][contrib] to see how you can get
