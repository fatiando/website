The Libraries
=============

We maintain several Python libraries which are in various stages of development: from
early design to polished and published products. We'll also be adding new projects to
our toolkit in the future (see how you can :ref:`get involved <contribute>`).

   Have a look at our
   <a href="https://github.com/fatiando/contributing/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Contributing Guide</a>
   to see how you can get involved.

Code of Conduct
---------------

All Fatiando projects are released with a
`Contributor Code of Conduct <https://github.com/fatiando/contributing/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`__.
By participating in any of these projects you agree to abide by its terms.

Imposter Syndrome Disclaimer
----------------------------

**We want your help.** No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're
not ready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good
enough to contribute.
What could you possibly offer?

We assure you that the little voice in your head is wrong.

**Being a contributor doesn't just mean writing code**.
Equality important contributions include:
writing or proof-reading documentation, suggesting or implementing tests, or
even giving feedback about the project (including giving feedback about the
contribution process).
If you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, you might see the errors and
assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.
If you can write any code at all, you can contribute code to open source.
We are constantly trying out new skills, making mistakes, and learning from
those mistakes.
That's how we all improve and we are happy to help others learn.

Looking for the ``fatiando`` package?
=====================================

**It still exists!**
While development of the ``fatiando`` library has stopped (in favor of
:ref:`our new libraries <projects>`),
you can still view the
`documentation for the last release (v0.5) <https://www.fatiando.org/v0.5/>`__
and the `source code archive on Github <https://github.com/fatiando/fatiando>`__.
The library will remain archived and usable for the foreseeable future.

To get a sense for the reasoning behind the choice to abandon ``fatiando``, please read
`this blog post <http://www.leouieda.com/blog/future-of-fatiando.html>`__.
Quoting from a section from the post:

   Back [when we started Fatiando], there were very few Python geophysical modeling
   libraries. A decade later, the ecosystem has expanded. The five currently on going
   projects of which I'm aware are:

   * `PyGMI <https://github.com/Patrick-Cole/pygmi>`__: GUI + library for 3D modeling
     of gravity and magnetic data.
   * `SimPEG <http://simpeg.xyz/>`__: Forward modeling and inversion library based on
     the finite volume method.
   * `pyGIMLi <https://www.pygimli.org/>`__: Forward modeling and inversion library
     based on the finite element and finite volume methods.
   * `Bruges <https://github.com/agile-geoscience/bruges>`__: Modeling and processing
     for seismic and petrophysics.
   * `Pyrocko <https://pyrocko.org>`__: A collection of tools and libraries, mostly
     for seismology.

   The two projects that are most similar to us (SimPEG and pyGIMLi) implement flexible
   partial differential equation solvers that they use to run all forward modeling
   calculations. This makes a lot of sense because it gives them a unified framework to
   model most geophysical methods. It is the most sensible approach to build joint
   inversions of multiple geophysical datasets. However, there are some inverse problems
   that don't fit this paradigm, like inverting Moho relief from gravity data and some
   non-conventional inversion algorithms [...]

   [...]

   The niche I see for Fatiando is in gravity and magnetic methods, particularly using
   [analytical solutions for forward modeling and non-PDE based inversions]. The
   processing functions are an important feature because there are hardly any
   open-source alternatives out there to commercial software like Oasis Montaj and
   Intrepid.

   [...]

   The best way forward for Fatiando that I can see, is to become an ecosystem of
   specialized tools and libraries, rather than a single Python package. Having things
   in separate libraries allows us to better indicate what is robust and professional
   and what is experimental or meant as a teaching tool.
